# Song's Uniqueness 
`song_uniqueness.py` calculates the number of unique words in lyrics. In other words, it removes repetitive words and calculates how many unique words are out of all words in lyrics.

This project was created as a part of learning in Tribe of AI Vilnius.

## Quick start
* Save lyrics you want to analyze as separate `.txt` files. (You can quickly download some examples from [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1MPwAwUWjebP5F7LJu1fvlOxytfp5LRxq).
* In terminal run `song_uniqueness.py`
